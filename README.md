# Draughts Game

The project is made for **COMP2215** module for **University of Southampton** 2018-2019.


Immerse in the dramatic gameplay just like Achilles and Ajax did in the 12th century BC. The draughts game offers incredible gameplay for two keen-minded strategy-oriented players. The rules of the game follow classic guidelines.

To launch the game simply run makefile, however, you will need avr-gcc/avr-g++, gnu make and dfu-programmer installed.

Possible improvements include a nicely themed intro and simple algorithm so that the player can compete with the computer.
